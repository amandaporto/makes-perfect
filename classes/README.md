To run the code:
  `ruby test_classes.rb`

Remove the `skip` from the first test, make that test pass by changing the code in `classes.rb` -- do not change the code in `test_classes.rb` except for removing `skip` lines.

NOTE: You may have to go back and change code you wrote previously to make a new test pass. Don't be afraid to change the code in `classes.rb` as needed, but run the tests *often* to make sure you aren't making an old test fail while making a new test pass.
