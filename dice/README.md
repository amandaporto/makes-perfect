* This practice uses a set of _tests_
* To run the test suite:
  ```
  ruby specs.rb
  ```
* You will see a list of tests that *fail*
* Find the first test failure (by line number) and update the code in `dice.rb` and `game.rb` until the test no longer fails. For example, The _first_ failing test is on lines `21-25` of `specs.rb`
* Only change the code in `dice.rb` or `game.rb` to make the tests pass. Do not change `specs.rb`
